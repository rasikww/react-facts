                    React was originally created by Jordan Walke, a software
                    engineer at Facebook.

                    React is used by Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, as well
                    as many popular websites and apps.

                    The first version of React was called "FaxJS" and was used
                    internally at Facebook.
                </li>
                <li>
                    React is not a full-fledged framework like Angular or Vue,
                    but rather a "view library" that can be used with other
                    libraries and frameworks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    React is known for its "virtual DOM", which is a lightweight
                    in-memory representation of the real DOM.
